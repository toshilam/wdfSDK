## Browser Compatibility

The best way to use `shortid` in the browser is via [browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).

These tools will automatically only include the files necessary for browser compatibility.

All tests will run in the browser as well:

```bash
# build the bundle, then open Mocha in a browser to see the tests run.
$ grunt build open
```
